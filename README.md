# Caeser Cipher Encoding Program
# Objective: 
- Develop a Java application that encodes text using the Caesar Cipher method. This project demonstrates foundational concepts of cryptography by allowing users to shift letters within the alphabet by a specified number, thus encrypting messages.

# Languages Used: 
- Java

# Key Features:
- Text Encryption: The application includes functionality to encrypt text using the Caesar Cipher method, which shifts each letter by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

- Shift Configuration: Alongside basic text encryption, the application allows users to specify the shift value (or key), which controls how many positions each letter is shifted. This is crucial for customizing the security level of the encryption and demonstrates how key management is handled in encryption schemes.
  
- Input Validation and Error Handling: The Caesar Cipher can process and validate user inputs, accepting valid texts and shift values while rejecting non-integer shift entries. This mimics real-world data validation techniques used in security applications to ensure reliable and error-free operation.

- Interactive Command-Line Interface: Users interact with the cipher through a simple command-line interface, which provides prompts to input the text to be encrypted and the desired shift value. The interface also displays the encoded text and offers real-time feedback on the encoding process, enhancing user engagement and understanding of encryption operations.
